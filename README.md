# About-Me

This is a Portfolio type website, this was one of my first websites that I ever created. 
This is my version of the website, that I was taught by Dr. Angela Yu from her [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)


It was a really fun experience, little did I know that I'm going to love Web-Development and pursue it as a Career option.

Here's the live deployed version of it: [Live Preview](https://adityaverm-a.github.io/about-me/)
